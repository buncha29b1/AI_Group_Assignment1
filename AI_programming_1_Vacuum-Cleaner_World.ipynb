    "We have created a **pygame** implementation of the game. It is not a sophisticated implementation - it is rather straightforward, designed not to test your programming skills but to help you understand the course's material and introduce you to pygame (in case you find it fun to play around).\n",

    "\n",
    "In one of the cells there is a robot vacuum cleaner, in our implementation depicted as a gray circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot is allowed to move one cell up, down, right or left. To move the robot, all you have to do is to click to the cell you want to move the robot to, but only within the robot's legal neighbourhood. Once on a cell with dirt, your robot vacuum cleaner can clean it up by double-clicking on the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is, to clean the dirt from all the dirty cells. It is pretty easy and not an inspiring game, but it serves as a good canvas for learning how to implement some of the algorithms and techniques we learn in our class.\n",

    "In the window of the game, you can quit the game, or draw a new game, by clicking the corresponding buttons.\n",

    "> The function has to, given the placement (that is, the coordinates) of the robot, the cells of the grid and the ones that are dirty, to explore the legal moves and find a path (sequence of cells) to clean all the dirty cells from dirt [Notice, we are not looking for the most optimal path to clean all the dirty cells, just a path]. The function should return a structure that contains the order in which the legal cells were visited by the algorithm. You need to *insert* the code at the appropriate place inside the main function of the game, so that, once a new game starts, bfs() runs and prints the order in which the legal cells would be visited by the BFS algorithm.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Your code has to be able to work alongside the code for the game, so that we could use it. When it comes to the logic of the function, we remind you that in the notebook `uninformed_search_exercises` you worked on the BFS algorithm on a toy example. We recommend you use that code as inspiration and as a starting point for your code in Task 7, as by doing that, your task will be very straightforward!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For this game, you need to consider that for the BFS's sake, the \"legal moves\" are not just moving up, down, right and left, but also, suck dirt! Remember when in the first lessons we talked and worked extensively about defining a problem as a search game and figuring out the legal moves!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We provide you a function called get_next_states, which is going to be used inside your BFS function. Familiarize yourselves with the function and make sure you understand what it does. Then, for your BFS, we provide some extra help by sketching out the logic that you need to implement **additionally to the logic of the algorithm**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Helping sketch:\n",
    "> After you take the next state to expand, after you have checked if that state has been visited already, you need to update the next_states and dirt_cells,as those are produced through the given get_next_states function. The idea here is that, if the next state to expand is in the produced next_states, then you need to add the state \"sucked dirt\" in your visited structure... Also, consider, what is the goal state here? Is it to reach a particular cell or a particular state? What is that state? How can you check if that state has been reached in your BFS function, so that the while loop stops and the algorithm stops and then returns the visited structure?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Grading: 15/30 Points are awarded for the logic of the BFS function's implementation. Does it use the right data structure? Does it do what it is meant to do? The rest of the points are awarded for using the function in the game. That is, have you placed it at the right location in the main so that the algorithm is run at each new game? Does the function return the right result (in the right structure, in the rigth format and with the right content)?"
